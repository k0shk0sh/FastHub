## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Why can't I see my <b>Organizations</b> either <i>Private</i> or <i>Public</i> ones?</summary>
  <p>Open up https://github.com/settings/applications and look for FastHub, open it then scroll to Organization access and click on Grant Button,
  alternatively login via <b>Access Token</b> which will ease this setup.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I tried to login via Access Token & OTP but why isn't it working?</summary>
  <p>You can't login via Access Token & OTP all together due to the lifetime of the OTP code, you'll be required to login in every few seconds.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why are my Private Repo and Enterprise Wiki not showing up?</summary>
  <p>It's due to FastHub scraping GitHub Wiki page & Private Repos require session token that FastHub doesn't have.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I login with Enterprise account but can't interact with anything other than my Enterprise GitHub.</summary>
  <p>Well, logically, you can't access anything else other than your Enterprise, but FastHub made that possible but can't do much about it, in most cases since your login credential doesn't exists in GitHub server. But in <b>few</b> cases your GitHub account Oauth token will do the trick.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Why am I having problems editing Issues/PRs?</summary>
  <p>If you are unable to edit an issue in a public organization, please contact your Organization Admin to grant access to FastHub. Alternatively you can login using an Access Token with the correct permissions granted.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I'm having this issue! / I want this and that!</summary>
  <p>Head to https://github.com/k0shk0sh/FastHub/issues/new and create new issue for bugs or feature requests. I really encourage you to search before opening a ticket. Any duplicate request will result in it being closed immediately.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How do I get PROMO CODE?</summary>
  <p>Please refer to the in-app FAQ for details.</p>
